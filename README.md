# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application

The goal of this application is for a user to be able to look through a set of their favorite artists and see what grammy accolades they are given, what age they are, and whether they are still alive

### Usability Principles Considered

I wanted to make the patterns for this very memorable by keep the artist attributes simple and consistently structured. I used the component strucutre in order to achieve this

### Organization of Components
Seperated between
-Header
-List
-Main
-Player

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
Classic component attributes that are passed in from main to the player component

### How the User Triggers State Changes
The different buttons allow state changes based on filtering
